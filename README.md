## Helpful Tools

- [PostMan](https://www.getpostman.com/) - desktop app for quick & easy endpoint testing
- [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) - Node version manager

## Prerequisites & Setup Steps

1. **Install the latest LTS version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/)**. [How to install Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
2. **Verify you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine**

    Most machines come pre-loaded with git. ðŸŽ‰

    To verify you have `git`, open up your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    which git
    ```

    This should return a path of where git is installed. If the command returns `git not found`, we will need to install git on your machine.

3. **Setup a Netlify account**.Â 

    If you don't already have an Netlify account, let's get one setup.

    [Click here to setup a free Netlify account](http://app.netlify.com)

4. **[Install Netlify CLI](https://cli.netlify.com/)**

    Open up your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    npm install netlify-cli -g
    ```

5. **Connect the Netlify CLI with your Netlify account**.Â 

    Open up your terminal and run:

    ```bash
    netlify login
    ```

6. **Verify the Netlify CLI works on your machine**

    Open up your terminal and run:

    ```
    netlify --help
    ```

    This should return the list of commands from the CLI tool.

**Bonus setup:**

- Install [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) for quick & easy testing of endpoints we deploy
- It's also recommended that you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (node version manager) just in case you need to change versions of node for the workshop.
