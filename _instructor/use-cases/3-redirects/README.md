# Using functions for Dynamic Redirects

This lesson will walk through creating a function that will handle dynamic redirects.

You can handle static redirects with [Netlify's redirect engine](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/) but sometimes we need the ability to handle dynamic redirects based on the request. Serverless functions are a perfect fit for this type of functionality.

## Lesson Steps

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_LESSONS_STEPS)-->
1. Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project.

    The `netlify.toml` file is where we configure how the site builds and where your serverless functions live.

2. In `netlify.toml`, add a `[build]` section and add `publish` and `functions` values

3. We need to create this site in Netlify

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify init
    ```

    Choose manual deployments

4. In `functions/redirect.js`, set `headers` key of the function response object.

      Set the `"Location"` & `"Cache-Control"` headers to redirect the `GET` request to a new URL.

5. After configuring your redirect, its time to deploy

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify deploy -p
    ```

6. Invoke the function to ensure it's working properly

    Visit your site and the URL https://your-site-url.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/redirect

    It should redirect you to a new location.
