## Lesson Steps

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_LESSONS_STEPS)-->
1. Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project.

    The `netlify.toml` file is where we configure how the site builds and where your serverless functions live.

3. We need to create this site in Netlify

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify init
    ```

    Choose manual deployments

5. After configuring your redirect, its time to deploy

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify deploy -p
    ```

6. Invoke the function to ensure it's working properly

    Visit your site and the URL https://your-site-url.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/redirect

    It should redirect you to a new location.
