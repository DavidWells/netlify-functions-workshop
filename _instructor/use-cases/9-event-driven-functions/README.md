## Lesson Steps

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (GENERATE_LESSONS_STEPS)-->
1. Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project.

    The `netlify.toml` file is where we configure how the site builds and where your serverless functions live.

2. In `netlify.toml`, add a `[build]` section and add `publish = "site"` and `functions = "functions"` values

3. We need to create this site in Netlify

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify init --manual
    ```

    Choose "create & configure a new site", then add a site name or hit enter for one to be generated for you.
