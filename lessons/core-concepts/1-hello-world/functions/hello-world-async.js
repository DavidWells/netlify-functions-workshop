  /* Step 7. Create the async function response

    In this_file, Create a `200` response code and return the `event` data in the response body.

    The response needs a `statusCode` and a `body` object returned. Remember to `JSON.stringify` the body.

    For more details, see the [docs](https://bit.ly/2uEFyKU)

    Remember this is an `async` function and we don't need to use the `callback` to return the response
