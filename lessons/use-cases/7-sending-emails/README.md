## Lesson Steps

1. Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project.

    The `netlify.toml` file is where we configure how the site builds and where your serverless functions live.

2. In `netlify.toml`, add a `[build]` section and add `publish = "site"` and `functions = "functions"` values

3. We need to create this site in Netlify

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify init
    ```

    Choose manual deployments

5. After configuring your redirect, its time to deploy

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify deploy -p
    ```

6. Invoke the function to ensure it's working properly

    Visit your site and the URL https://your-site-url.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/redirect

    It should redirect you to a new location.
