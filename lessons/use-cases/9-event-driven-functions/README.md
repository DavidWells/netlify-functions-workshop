This lesson will walk through creating event driven functions inside Netlify.

- [Lesson Steps](#lesson-steps)
- [Complete code](#complete-code)


## Lesson Steps

1. Create a `netlify.toml` file in your project.

    The `netlify.toml` file is where we configure how the site builds and where your serverless functions live.

2. In `netlify.toml`, add a `[build]` section and add `publish = "site"` and `functions = "functions"` values

3. We need to create this site in Netlify

    Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash
    netlify init
    ```

    Choose manual deployments
